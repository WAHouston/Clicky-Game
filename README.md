The [Clicky Game App](https://wahouston.github.io/Clicky-Game/) .
#### Usage
* Click the link [here](https://wahouston.github.io/Clicky-Game/) to access the app.
* When the user opens the app, they are presented with a page that has twelve cards with different pictures, a score counter (to keep track of your current score), and a top score counter (to keep track of your overall high score).
* When the user clicks one of the picture cards, it increments the score counter and shuffles the order of the picture cards.
* If the current score is higher than the top score, the top score is set to the current score.
* If the user clicks on a picture that they have previously clicked on, the current score is reset to zero while the top score will remain at the greatest number that it has reached.
